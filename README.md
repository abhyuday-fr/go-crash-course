These are some source codes I am writing as I am learning about the go language.
---
## ⚙️👨‍💻 To build and run the code
- ```cd``` to the desired directory in this project
- ```go build main.go```
- ```./main.exe```

## OR (if you are a linux user/ do not want to write this much)
- ```cd``` to the desired directory in this project
- ```go run main.go```
